# Applied Machine Learning Algorithms

## 📚 Overview
A collection of fundamental Machine Learning implementations exploring both Supervised and Unsupervised techniques. This repository serves as a benchmarking study of classifier performance on standard datasets.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
### Supervised Learning (Classification)
* **Logistic Regression:** Probabilistic modeling for categorical dependent variables.
* **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Dimensionality reduction and class separation.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Non-parametric classification based on feature proximity.

### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
* **K-Means Clustering:** Partitioning data into *k* distinct non-overlapping subgroups.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
* **Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, Silhouette Score, Classification Reports.

## 📊 Key Observations
* **LDA** proved effective for dimensionality reduction while maintaining class separability.
* **K-Means** successfully identified natural groupings in the data without label supervision.
